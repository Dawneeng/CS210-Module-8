Module 8 Journal

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.  For this project, we were to integrate python and C++, create an multiplication table in which the user could enter in a number and it would out print the answer. They could either multiply a number or double a number.

What did you do particularly well? It took me a little while to overcome some of the issues that were in the instructions that were not correct.  For example, in the intiating guide, it asks for one to keep the .py with in the code- if one did this, they would get an error.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? I am still learning to code, I think that I am getting better day by day with on going practice.  If I was more fluent with my code, I think that I would have less chance to create an error that may lead to code that was less secure or efficient.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? The part I found most challenging was integrating the pyhton.  None of our university tutors are all that familiar with C++ and on top of that integrating both python and c++.  Thankfully, I was able to find an outside tutor who helped break down some of my challenges and explained to me the parts I did not understand.

What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? Tutors, codecademy, a tutorial on C++, freecodecamp

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?  I think that learning this level of a language makes it easier to learn less complex languages such as python.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Many, many hours and days of work.  Once I finished it was a great since of accomplishment.
